        <u>Abstract</u>
        Per-flow measurement is a critical issue in computer networks,
        and one of its key tasks is to count the number of packets in each flow.
        The literature has demonstrated that sketch is the most memory-efficient
        data structure for the counting task, and is widely used in distributed systems.
        Existing sketches often use many counters of the same size to record the number
        of packets in a flow, thus the counters need to be large enough to accommodate
        the size of the largest flow. Unfortunately, as most flows are small and only a
        very few flows are large, many counters represent small values, which is a waste
        of memory. Sketches are often stored in fast but expensive memory, thus it is
        critical to achieve high memory efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
        the Diamond sketch, which is composed of atom sketches, and each atom sketch
        uses small counters. The key idea of Diamond is to dynamically assign an
        appropriate number of atom sketches to each flow on demand, optimizing memory
        efficiency. Experimental results show that the Diamond sketch outperforms the
        best of the five typical sketches by up to 508.3 times in terms of relative
        error while keeping comparable speed.
